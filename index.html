<h1> Hello, and welcome to my webpage! </h1>
        
<p> This website will be my programming protfolio for my CSC106 class at URI. Here, I will showcase all of my wonderful projects I have completed, and maybe some other interesting stuff as well. I'm very excited to update this page as the semester goes on.
